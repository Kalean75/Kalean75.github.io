				<p> My name is Devin White, I was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah, as the middle child of 3 brothers.</p>
				<p> I graduated highschool in 2012, and then attended the University of Utah, where I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Geoscience.<p>
				<p> After teaching myself Python and messing around with Unity over the course of a summer, I found I had a passion for programming</p>
				<p> I found teaching myself how to program fairly difficult, and decided I needed to take a more structured program, As such, I decided to return to School to pursue a second Degree in Computer Science<p>
				<p>Currently, I am working as a Metallurgist while going to school full time.</p>
				<p> In my free time, I can usually be found skiing in the winter, or hiking, biking, camping, or floating white water in the spring and summer.<p>
				<p> I also am an avid gamer, and play a lot when I'm not outside, accordingly, one of my dreams is to eventually develop an indie game using the skills I've learned in both school and on my own.</p>

		<h2> Course Reflection</h2>
		<p> Overall, I found this course to be quite enjoyable, as it allowed my to blend my love of art and design with my love of programming<p>
		<p> Javascript I found to be the easiest part to learn, as I already had a background in both Python and Java, so most of the concepts tended to be the same<p>
		<p> Similarly, HTML itself is fairly easy and straightforward, with the only real requirements being remembering tags, and having a good sense of layout</p>
		<p> CSS however, was a huge pain for me, stuff like floats and wrapping and other concepts were extremely confusing for me at first, oftentimes resulting in total breaking of the page layout<p>
		<p> However, once I started to get more proficient at it, it became amazing, as you can manipulate a whole lot with it, and it allows for one to use their aesthetic eye to open a world of near infinite possibilities</p>
		<p> While I've tended to be more of a "back end" guy, I feel that knowing at least the basics of web-design is a very important skill to be familiar with, and this course more then delivered on that front</p>
		<p>Bootstrap in particular is an extremely handy tool to know, and it's nice to be able to delv into such a thing in an intro level course</p>

		<h1 class = "learning-outcomes"><strong>SLCC's General Education Learning Outcomes</strong></h1>
		<strong><em>Students communicate effectively.</em>
		</strong><em>This includes developing critical literacies-reading, writing, speaking, listening, visual understanding - that they can apply in various contexts; Organizing and presenting ideas and information visually, orally, and in writing according to standard usage; Understanding and using the elements of effective communication in interpersonal, small group, and mass settings.</em>
		<p><strong> Taking online courses and working professionally at the same time, communication with my bosses, coworkers, fellow students and professors is a must so that everything can go smoothly</strong></p>
		<br /><br /><strong><em>Students develop quantitative literacies necessary for their chosen field of study.</em></strong>
		<em>This includes approaching practical problems by choosing and applying appropriate mathematical techniques; Using information represented as data, graphs, tables, and schematics in a variety of disciplines; Applying mathematical theory, concepts, and methods of inquiry appropriate to program-specific problems.</em>
		<br>
		<p><strong> Programming in particular requires tons of practice, I am practicing after work virtually every day on both small and large projects.</strong></p>
		<br /><br /><strong><em>Students think critically and creatively.</em></strong><em>This includes reasoning effectively from available evidence; Demonstrating effective problem solving; Engaging in creative thinking, expression, and application; Engaging in reflective thinking and expression; Demonstrating higher-order skills such as analysis, synthesis, and evaluation; Making connections across disciplines; Applying scientific methods to the inquiry process.</em>
		<br>
		<p><strong> Creative thinking is an important part of any science based program. My CSIS projects in 1430(linked on this page) and other courses are great examples of my ability to think critically</strong></p>
		<br>
		<br /><br /><em><strong>Students develop civic literacy and the capacity to be community-engaged learners who act in mutually beneficial ways with community partners</strong>. This includes producing learning artifacts indicating understanding of the political, historical, economic or sociological aspects of social change and continuity; thinking critically about and weighing the evidence surrounding issues important to local, national, or global communities; participating in a broad range of community-engagement and/or service-learning courses for community building and an enhanced academic experience.&nbsp;</em>
		<br>
		<p><strong> I volunteer cleaning up the local park, as well as assisting with the local boy scout troop(I myself am a proud Eagle scout and the program helped me become a civic minded individual)</strong></p>
		<br>
		<br /><br /><strong><em>Students develop the knowledge and skills to work with others in a professional and constructive manner.</em></strong><em>This includes engaging with a diverse set of others to produce professional work; Interacting competently across cultures; Understanding and appreciating human differences; Understanding and acting on standards of professionalism and civility, including the SLCC Student Code of Conduct.</em>
		<br>
		<p><strong> Group projects are a fundamental part of virtually ever class. Two examples are a rock paper scissors game made in CSIS 1400, and a Nato phonetic alphabet project I made in CSIS 1410</strong></p>
		<br>
		<br /><br /><strong><em>Students develop computer and information literacy.</em></strong><em>This includes using contemporary computer hardware and software to effectively complete college-level assignments; Gathering and analyzing information using technology, library resources, and other modalities; Understanding and acting upon ethical and security principles with respect to computer technology and to information acquisition and distribution; Distinguishing between credible and non-credible sources of information, and using the former in their work in an appropriately documented fashion.</em>
		<br>
		<p> <strong>My major is computer Science, as such, computer literacy is an integral part of my day to day life</strong></p>
		<br>
		<br /><br /><strong><em>Students develop the attitudes and skills for lifelong wellness.</em>
		</strong><em>This includes understanding the importance of physical activity and its connection to lifelong wellness; Learning how participation in a fitness, sport or leisure activity results in daily benefits including stress reduction, endorphin release, and a sense of well-being.</em>
		<br>
		<p><strong>My dedication to lifelong wellness is expressed in my hobbies, I'm almost always outside in the fresh air doing some sort of physical activity</strong></p>

		<h2> Outside the Classroom </h2>
		<p> Outside the classroom, I am currently working as a metallurgist, as such, I am learning a wide variety of testing procedures in a lab environment</p>
		<p> Working full time while taking courses full time has been a struggle, as I have virtually no free time compared to what I'm used to.<p>
		<p> When I do have free time, I have largely been messing around with development platforms such as unity in the hopes of becoming proficient enough to make my own games</P>
		<p> My summers are primarily spent camping, hiking, or doing whitewater sports, typically going to the Uintas for the weekend or out of state for longer trips</p>
